In this small project, I created a simple recipes page that links to two recipes from the ALLRECIPES website, I made it look nice and orderly, and pushed to github when appropriate as well as having proper commit messages. 
This project was to test everything Ive learned so far and put my own twist on it, as well as learning how to use github.
